# Temperature Calculator

This repository contains a project developed in the "Construção de Software para Web" class of the Computer Science course at Universidade Vila Velha.

The objective of this project is to provide a simple temperature calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to convert temperature values between different scales such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Features

- Temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
- Well-organized and modularized codebase, serving as an example for studying or creating similar projects.
- User-friendly interface with a clean and responsive design.
- Real-time conversion and display of temperature results.
- Guide section providing quick instructions for usage.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the temperature you want to convert in the input field, following the format: [value][scale], e.g., "23C" for 23 degrees Celsius.
4. Observe the converted temperature values in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

Feel free to explore the source code, make modifications, and adapt it to your needs. If you find any improvements or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Additional Information

The temperature calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code handles the conversion logic and updates the results in real-time. The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

The background color of the page dynamically changes based on the input temperature in Celsius. Temperatures below -50°C display a blue color, temperatures above 200°C display a red color, and temperatures in between are represented by varying hues in the range. This visual feature adds an interactive element to the calculator.

Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and use it as a reference for your own projects. Contributions, suggestions, and improvements are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have ideas for enhancing the calculator's functionality, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
